Example recode statements in SAS/STAT® to concord new and old SAT® values

## Overview
Each .txt file in this repository provides the SAS/STAT® syntax to recode an SAT® or ACT® variable into a new or old format. The name of each file reflects the transformation contained in the file. Simply copy/paste the full IF/THEN/ELSE command into your program and find/replace the sample variable names with your variable names. At this time, we do not have reproducible example syntax for each recode command, but we are working on porting these commands into user-defined functions that will be released in a single .sas file.
