Example recode statements in SAS to concord new and old SAT values

## Overview
Each .txt file in this repository provides the SAS syntax to recode an SAT or ACT variable into a new or old format. The name of each file reflects the transformation contained in the file. Simply copy/paste the full IF/THEN/ELSE command into your SAS program and find/replace the sample variable names with your variable names. At this time, we do not have reproducible example syntax for SAS, but feel free to write, test, and submit one as a pull request.
